Car plate recognition system that recognizes and reads License Plate Number from automobiles using RaspberryPi and OpenCV.
In particular, the program recognizes the number plate usingOpenCV Contour Detection and then reads the number from the plate using Tesseract OCR.
There is also a GUI that will help the user to use the application. The application will use the plate detected to offer the user two possible games: 'Hangman' and 'Guess the city'.
